# Senior-Project

# Introduction
  
Organizing marathons entails several obstacles like ensuring participant safety, tracking positions, detecting cheating, and managing data efficiently. To address these, a cost-effective device is proposed that uses a microcontroller with LoRa technology, GPS, IMU sensors, and an OLED screen to monitor runners' speed, position, status, and transmit data in real-time. To keep pace with the world charging standards, we made the product to support wireless charging.

# Problem Statement

Marathons present a unique set of challenges, both for runners and organizers. In this project, we 
intend to help marathon organizers to overcome the difficulties they face when they organize 
marathon events. 
---
**There are two types of challenges:**


   **Technical challenges:**
   
       o Tracking: The product must accurately track the position of each runner and detect a 
      player when taking a shortcut.
      
       o Collecting crucial data: Combining the data of each runner to one station which is 
      Google Realtime Firebase, displaying them as fast and accurate as possible.
      
       o Position monitoring: Monitor runners’ position at the finish line.
       
       o Detect collapsing conditions using the IMU

   **Non-technical challenges:**
 
       o Guiding participants: Ensuring they correctly use the product.
       
       o Cost effectiveness: Accurately compare different designs’ cost. 



# CONCLUSION

To sum up, the developed product has combined both sports and technologies and made a 
significant contribution to organizing marathon events in addition to motivating runners to 
participate.
